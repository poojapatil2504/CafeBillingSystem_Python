# CafeBillingSystem_Python

This mini-project demonstrates a basic cafe billing system implemented in Python using the Tkinter framework. The system allows users to input the quantity of items ordered and calculates the total bill. It also includes features such as displaying item prices and generating order numbers. The inclusion of a simple calculator within the system provides additional functionality for customer budgeting.
Overall, this project is a good starting point for learning about GUI development in Python and basic billing system logic.
